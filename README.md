Cloude is a cloud storage web app similar to Google Drive, built using Next.js 15 with TypeScript. It enables users to upload, manage, and share files and folders seamlessly. With features like starred items and search functionality, Cloude provides a minimal yet powerful user experience.

## Features

### 1. File & Folder Upload
- Upload single or multiple files at once (supports all formats: media, docs, etc.).
- Upload entire folders, including nested files and subfolders, while maintaining hierarchy.

### 2. File & Folder Sharing
- Share files or folders with other users by entering their email.
- Shared items appear in the recipient's storage if they have an account.

### 3. Starred Items
- Users can mark files or folders as starred for quick access.


4. Search Functionality
- Search for files or folders (own or shared) using name, type, or extension (e.g., .pdf, .jpg).

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with TypeScript
